@dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed\n behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n For example:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```\n contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n     function initialize() initializer public {\n         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n     }\n }\n contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n     }\n }\n ```\n TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n [CAUTION]\n ====\n Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\n the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```\n /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n constructor() {\n     _disableInitializers();\n }\n ```\n

constructor() {     _disableInitializers(); } ``` ====\",\"details\":\"This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized. For example: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ``` contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {     function initialize() initializer public {         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");     } } contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");     } } ``` TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:

This implementation returns the same URI for *all* token types. It relies on the token type ID substitution mechanism https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155#metadata[defined in the EIP]. Clients calling this function must replace the `\\\\{id\\\\}` substring with the actual token type ID.\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/MyNFT.sol\":\"MyNFT\"},\"evmVersion\":\"london\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xd917747dc87f189c6779b894f367a028f9dca4be930283cccec8f312966af820\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://7a5e5b99830cf233f77aa3b1bd1f57561faee103beeee88e6a6f86d044817bbb\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmREYidSDpHPig3AhxzsMHg3w2ZtMeGfRhcokXxEZyj6fC\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC1155/IERC1155.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x6392f2cfe3a5ee802227fe7a2dfd47096d881aec89bddd214b35c5b46d3cd941\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://bd9c47a375639888e726a99da718890ba16d17d7ad9eacb0ccc892d46d1b3ee0\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qmb41W5RUjy2sWg49A2rMnxekSeEk6SvGyJL5tyCCSr7un\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC1155/IERC1155Receiver.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xeb373f1fdc7b755c6a750123a9b9e3a8a02c1470042fd6505d875000a80bde0b\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://0e28648f994abf1d6bc345644a361cc0b7efa544f8bc0c8ec26011fed85a91ec\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmVVE7AiRjKaQYYji7TkjmTeVzGpNmms5eoxqTCfvvpj6D\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC1155/extensions/IERC1155MetadataURI.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xa66d18b9a85458d28fc3304717964502ae36f7f8a2ff35bc83f6f85d74b03574\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://e46c80ea068989111d6103e5521223f9ef337e93de76deed8b03f75c6f7b2797\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmNoSE6knNfFncdDDLTb3fGR6oSQty1srG96Vsx3E9wQdw\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Address.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xf96f969e24029d43d0df89e59d365f277021dac62b48e1c1e3ebe0acdd7f1ca1\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://ec772b45a624be516f1c81970caa8a2e144301e9d0921cbc1a2789fef39a1269\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmNyjwxCrGhQMyzLD93oUobJXVe9ceJvRvfXwbEtuxPiEj\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xe2e337e6dde9ef6b680e07338c493ebea1b5fd09b43424112868e9cc1706bca7\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://6df0ddf21ce9f58271bdfaa85cde98b200ef242a05a3f85c2bc10a8294800a92\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmRK2Y5Yc6BK7tGKkgsgn3aJEQGi5aakeSPZvS65PV8Xp3\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/ERC165.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xd10975de010d89fd1c78dc5e8a9a7e7f496198085c151648f20cba166b32582b\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://fb0048dee081f6fffa5f74afc3fb328483c2a30504e94a0ddd2a5114d731ec4d\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmZptt1nmYoA5SgjwnSgWqgUSDgm4q52Yos3xhnMv3MV43\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/IERC165.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x447a5f3ddc18419d41ff92b3773fb86471b1db25773e07f877f548918a185bf1\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://be161e54f24e5c6fae81a12db1a8ae87bc5ae1b0ddc805d82a1440a68455088f\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmP7C3CHdY9urF4dEMb9wmsp1wMxHF6nhA2yQE5SKiPAdy\"]},\"contracts/MyNFT.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x544089828077f258d5b1411fbfd7f6c5b2d2992f5f79f1d0ee492e2ba638bcf0\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://fbea4a6c4d9ce489d68d5245e9b1eb4af4e70fc4fd58ddb2fc2fe0fdf4c1f9f8\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmVoK9KJtuyjFcxVPWAsv3eWMpT6Jhnz1nyaxKaotaVg8g\"]}},\"version\":1}","storageLayout":{"storage":[{"astId":1442,"contract":"contracts/MyNFT.sol:MyNFT","label":"_balances","offset":0,"slot":"0","type":"t_mapping(t_uint256,t_mapping(t_address,t_uint256))"},{"astId":1448,"contract":"contracts/MyNFT.sol:MyNFT","label":"_operatorApprovals","offset":0,"slot":"1","type":"t_mapping(t_address,t_mapping(t_address,t_bool))"},{"astId":1450,"contract":"contracts/MyNFT.sol:MyNFT","label":"_uri","offset":0,"slot":"2","type":"t_string_storage"}],"types":{"t_address":{"encoding":"inplace","label":"address","numberOfBytes":"20"},"t_bool":{"encoding":"inplace","label":"bool","numberOfBytes":"1"},"t_mapping(t_address,t_bool)":{"encoding":"mapping","key":"t_address","label":"mapping(address
